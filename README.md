# network_analyzer
Linux Network Analyzer
Introduction
This is a simple network analyzer tool for Linux that uses the dpkt library to capture and analyze network traffic. The tool captures network packets and provides information about the packets such as source and destination IP addresses, protocol type, and packet size.
Requirements
Python 3
dpkt library (can be installed using pip install dpkt)
Root or administrative privileges (to capture network traffic at a low level)
Usage
Clone the repository or download the script
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located
Run the script using sudo python network_analyzer.py
Output
The script will capture network traffic and provide the following information for each packet:

Source IP address
Destination IP address
Protocol type (e.g. TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.)
Packet size
The output will be displayed in the terminal in real-time. The script will continue to capture and display information until it is stopped by the user (e.g. by pressing CTRL + C).
Notes
Capturing network traffic at a low level requires a deep understanding of network protocols and can be dangerous if done improperly. Use this tool with caution and at your own risk.
The output generated by the script is intended for informational purposes only and is not guaranteed to be accurate or complete.
